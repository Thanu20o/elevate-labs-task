This project demonstrates practical network reconnaissance and security assessment using industry-standard tools. The objective was to perform comprehensive network scanning, identify active services, analyze potential vulnerabilities, and document security findings in a professional manner.
In this network security assessment task, I performed comprehensive network reconnaissance using Nmap to identify active hosts and services within the 192.168.56.0/24 subnet. Through SYN stealth scanning, I discovered critical services including DNS (port 53), Microsoft RPC (port 135), NetBIOS (port 139), and SMB file sharing (port 445). The project involved analyzing potential security vulnerabilities associated with each open port, with particular focus on SMB's critical exposure to EternalBlue exploits and credential theft attacks. I documented the security risks systematically, prioritizing them based on exploit potential and business impact. The task also included configuring multiple output formats for professional reporting and implementing proper documentation practices. This hands-on exercise demonstrated practical skills in network mapping, vulnerability assessment, and security reporting, providing valuable experience in identifying and mitigating network-based security threats while following ethical scanning methodologies in a controlled environment.
