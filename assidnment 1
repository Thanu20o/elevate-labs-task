  Objectives
- Conduct network discovery and host enumeration
- Identify open ports and running services
- Analyze security risks associated with discovered services
- Document findings and provide mitigation recommendations
- Develop professional reporting skills for cybersecurity assessments

 Tools Used
- **Nmap 7.96** - Network mapping and port scanning
- **Windows Command Prompt** - System administration and network analysis
- **Git/GitHub** - Version control and documentation
- **TCP/IP Protocols** - Network communication analysis

 Tasks Performed

 Network Configuration Analysis
- Executed `ipconfig` command to map local network interfaces
- Identified IP addressing schemes across multiple adapters
- Documented network topology and segmentation
- Key Finding: Discovered VirtualBox NAT network (192.168.56.0/24) as primary scan target

. Network Scanning with Nmap
- Performed SYN Stealth Scan (`nmap -sS`) on 192.168.56.0/24 subnet
- Scanned 256 IP addresses to identify live hosts
- Utilized TCP connect methodology for comprehensive port discovery
-Command Used: `nmap -sS 192.168.56.1/24`

 3. Service Discovery & Enumeration
- Identified active hosts within the target subnet
- Discovered open TCP ports and associated services
- Documented service banners and port states
- Discovered Services:
  - Port 53/tcp - DNS Service (domain)
  - Port 135/tcp - Microsoft RPC Endpoint Mapper (msrpc)
  - Port 139/tcp - NetBIOS Session Service (netbios-ssn)
  - Port 445/tcp - SMB File Sharing (microsoft-ds)

4. Security Risk Assessment
 Critical Risks Identified:
- Port 445 (SMB): EternalBlue vulnerability potential, worm propagation risk
- Port 135 (MSRPC): Remote code execution vulnerabilities
- Port 139 (NetBIOS): Credential theft and session hijacking
- Port 53 (DNS): Information leakage and DNS tunneling possibilities

 Risk Prioritization:
| Service | Risk Level | Primary Threats |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| SMB (445/tcp) | CRITICAL | RCE, worm spread, pass-the-hash |
| MSRPC (135/tcp) | HIGH | Remote code execution, enumeration |
| NetBIOS (139/tcp) | HIGH | Credential theft, information disclosure |
| DNS (53/tcp) | MEDIUM-HIGH | Information leakage, cache poisoning |
